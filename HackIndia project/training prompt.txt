This chatbot is designed to provide accurate, context-aware, and enriched responses for domain-specific FAQs by integrating Knowledge Graphs with NLP models. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely on predefined responses, this system will dynamically retrieve structured data, recognize hierarchical relationships, and provide fact-based, insightful answers.
